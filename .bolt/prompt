For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

I need a full-stack web application with:

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Auth: Supabase (for user authentication and data management)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Core Features:
1. User authentication (login, registration, password reset).
2. A public blog for informational articles.
3. An online appointment booking system.
4. A dedicated section for parent coaching for children with Down syndrome and Autism.
5. An informative section with practical tips for children with ADHD.
6. An "About Us" page.

Start with the main page containing a modern, single-page-like feel with a clear navigation bar at the top right for "Ana Sayfa", "Blog", "Online Randevu", "Hakkımızda", and a "Login/Register" link.
